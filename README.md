**E-Commerce Sales Forecasting**

This repository provides a framework for building and evaluating sales forecasting models for e-commerce businesses. Accurate sales predictions are crucial for informed decision-making regarding:

- Inventory management: Optimize stock levels to prevent stockouts or excess inventory.
- Marketing campaigns: Target promotions strategically to drive sales during peak periods.
- Resource allocation: Allocate resources effectively based on anticipated demand.

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites:**
   - Python (3.x recommended)
   - Data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, NumPy)
   - Machine learning libraries (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch) â€“ Choose based on your preferred model type.

2. **Installation:**
   Clone this repository and install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/E-Commerce-Sales-Forecasting.git
   cd E-Commerce-Sales-Forecasting
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Replace with your actual requirements file, if applicable
   ```

**Data**

- The code assumes you have your e-commerce sales data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, Parquet).
- Place your data in the `data` directory.

**Structure**

- `data`: Stores your e-commerce sales data.
- `notebooks`: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with code for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- `models`: (Optional) If using custom models, this directory can hold your model implementations.
- `requirements.txt` (Optional): Lists the required Python libraries for project execution.
- `README.md` (This file): Provides project overview, instructions, and usage information.

**Usage**

- Open Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the desired notebook (e.g., `data_exploration.ipynb`, `model_training.ipynb`).
- Execute the code cells sequentially to perform data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

**Customization**

- Modify the code in the notebooks to explore different data features, model architectures, and evaluation metrics.
- Adapt the data loading and preprocessing steps to match your specific data format.
